# Pending questions (product and operations)

**Last updated:** 2026-04-21

Single place to track **decisions only a human owner** can make. When you ask what is still open, start here. Items marked **Resolved** stay for audit trail; remove them only when you intentionally shrink the file.

## Resolved (2026-04-21 — owner decisions)

| Topic | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| AWS agents / multi-cloud | **Deferred to V1.1** — Azure-first for V1. |
| Terraform `state mv` (Phase 7.5–7.8) | **Waived** — no maintenance window; resource addresses may retain historical tokens per ADR / rename checklist. |
| Commercial rails | **Stripe + Azure Marketplace** acceptable when each path is justified; ship Stripe before Marketplace unless a MACC buyer forces procurement path first. |
| Penetration testing | **Owner-conducted** security assessment (OWASP ASVS–style) until budget for **external** assessor; see [`docs/security/OWNER_SECURITY_ASSESSMENT_2026_Q2-DRAFT.md`](security/OWNER_SECURITY_ASSESSMENT_2026_Q2-DRAFT.md). |
| Cross-tenant pattern library | **Approved** (opt-in, k-anonymity, DPA carve-out) — requires ADR before implementation lands. |
| Azure subscriptions | **Staging:** existing subscription. **Production:** **second subscription** dedicated to prod (create empty; wire Terraform/CD after staging is green). |
| Production Azure subscription ID | **`aab65184-5005-4b0d-a884-9e28328630b1`** — recorded in [`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTIONS.md`](AZURE_SUBSCRIPTIONS.md) as the single source of truth. Operator action: set GitHub Environment secret `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` on the **`production`** environment to this value (and confirm sibling `AZURE_TENANT_ID` / `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` are populated for OIDC). Default region: **`centralus`**. |
| DNS / TLS | Owner **approves** DNS and TLS cutover for production hostnames. |
| Domain | **archlucid.com** — registration fee paid; confirm WHOIS when registrar completes. |
| Reference customer (GTM) | **Ship self-serve trial first** — first **paying** tenant becomes the first publishable reference (`TRIAL_FIRST_REFERENCE_CASE_STUDY.md`). |
| SOC 2 Type I/II | **Deferred** — interim posture is self-assessment + Trust Center honesty; revisit when ARR justifies CPA attestation. |

## Still open (needs your input later)

1. **Design-partner row (`DESIGN_PARTNER_NEXT`)** — When a **named** design partner (not PLG) is authorized, replace `<<CUSTOMER_NAME>>` in [`DESIGN_PARTNER_NEXT_CASE_STUDY.md`](go-to-market/reference-customers/DESIGN_PARTNER_NEXT_CASE_STUDY.md) and move the table row through **Drafting → Customer review → Published** per [`reference-customers/README.md`](go-to-market/reference-customers/README.md).

2. **External pen-test vendor** — When funded, award SoW, fill `<<vendor>>` / `<<TBD>>` in [`docs/security/pen-test-summaries/2026-Q2-SOW.md`](security/pen-test-summaries/2026-Q2-SOW.md), and replace placeholders in [`2026-Q2-REDACTED-SUMMARY.md`](security/pen-test-summaries/2026-Q2-REDACTED-SUMMARY.md) after delivery.

3. **PGP for `security@archlucid.dev`** — [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) still has a TODO: generate key pair, publish public key, link from Trust Center.

4. **Second first-party workflow integration** — GitHub manifest-delta action is shipped ([`docs/integrations/GITHUB_ACTION_MANIFEST_DELTA.md`](integrations/GITHUB_ACTION_MANIFEST_DELTA.md)). Next anchor (Confluence, ServiceNow, Azure DevOps) is a **product** call when a pipeline deal requires it.

## Six quality prompts (2026-04-20 independent assessment) — execution status

| Prompt | Intent | Repo status (2026-04-21) |
|--------|--------|--------------------------|
| **8.1** Reference customer + CI guard | Case study assets, table row, merge-blocking when `Published` | **Done** (auto-flip in `ci.yml`); **extended** with PLG case study + table row in this change set. |
| **8.2** `archlucid pilot up` | One-command Docker pilot | **Done** — [`ArchLucid.Cli/Commands/PilotUpCommand.cs`](../ArchLucid.Cli/Commands/PilotUpCommand.cs). *Note:* `POST /v1.0/demo/seed` is **Development-only** and needs **ExecuteAuthority**; the Docker path relies on **demo seed on startup** instead. |
| **8.3** First-value report | CLI + `GET /v1/pilots/runs/{id}/first-value-report` | **Done** — see CHANGELOG 2026-04-20. |
| **8.4** GitHub Action manifest delta | Composite action + docs + example workflow | **Done** — `integrations/github-action-manifest-delta/`, [`docs/integrations/GITHUB_ACTION_MANIFEST_DELTA.md`](integrations/GITHUB_ACTION_MANIFEST_DELTA.md). |
| **8.5** Persistence consolidation | Proposal doc only | **Done** — [`docs/PROJECT_CONSOLIDATION_PROPOSAL_PERSISTENCE.md`](PROJECT_CONSOLIDATION_PROPOSAL_PERSISTENCE.md). |
| **8.6** Pen-test publication path | Templates + Trust Center | **Done** — `docs/security/pen-test-summaries/`; **extended** with owner-assessment draft + Trust Center wording in this change set. |
